## Flink project

The `example` folder includes instructions on how to setup the Flink Kubernetes Operator and deploy a Flink job on a Kubernetes cluster.

The `slot_count_impact` folder contains a Flink job that measures the impact slot count per Task Manager has on the throughput of a Flink job. It includes scripts to run the experiments, collect metrics, and plot the results.
